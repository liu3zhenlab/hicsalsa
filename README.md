HiC scaffolding using Arima and Salsa pipelines
The Arima HiC data processing refers the pipeline from [VGP](https://github.com/VGP/vgp-assembly/tree/master/pipeline/salsa). The original Arima pipeline can be found from [ArimaGenomics](https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline). The [Arima manual](https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline/blob/master/Arima_Mapping_UserGuide_A160156_v02.pdf) well documented the procedure. The Salsa2 package was downloaded from the [Salsa GitHub](https://github.com/marbl/SALSA).
